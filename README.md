# Oction
I used Android studio 2.2, min supported SDK was 23 to use some features,
but I can downgrade it, I used Dagger 2 for dependency injection,
Retrofit to make network request, Rx java 2+ Rx android to execute actions and control data flow,
retro lambda to use lambda feature, Mockito and JUnit to do local tests on JVM for presenter and interactor,
I used MVP design pattern using predefined template scaffolded by cookiecutter.
